Hi, I’m Yi Chen, currently a second-year master's student in Economics at Duke University. I’m applying for PhD in Quantitative Marketing for Fall 2025. My research interests focus on misinformation, recommendation systems, and influencer marketing. I am particularly interested in leveraging methodologies such as causal inference, probabilistic machine learning, and applied econometrics to address empirical marketing challenges within these domains. Prior to Duke, I earned my undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

To learn more about my academic background and research experience, please refer to my CV.
