About Me
======

Hi, I’m Yi Chen, a second-year master's student in Economics at Duke University. I’m applying for PhD in Quantitative Marketing for Fall 2025. My research interests focus on misinformation, recommendation systems, and influencer marketing. I am passionate about using methodologies such as causal inference, probabilistic machine learning, and applied econometrics to address empirical marketing challenges within these domains. Prior to Duke, I earned my undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

For more details about my academic journey and research, feel free to check out my CV.
